Traditional Locators
Selenium provides support for these 8 traditional location strategies in WebDriver:

Locator	Description
* class name	Locates elements whose class name contains the search value (compound class names are not permitted)
* css selector	Locates elements matching a CSS selector
* id	Locates elements whose ID attribute matches the search value
* name	Locates elements whose NAME attribute matches the search value
* link text	Locates anchor elements whose visible text matches the search value
* partial link text	Locates anchor elements whose visible text contains the search value. If multiple elements are matching, only the first one will be selected.
* tag name	Locates elements whose tag name matches the search value
* xpath	Locates elements matching an XPath expression
